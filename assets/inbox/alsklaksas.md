I'm starting a new [language/framework] project. Please help me create a comprehensive .gitignore file that:
1. Excludes common system and IDE files
2. Ignores language-specific build artifacts and dependencies
3. Ensures no sensitive information (like API keys) is accidentally committed

Please provide explanations for any non-obvious entries.
