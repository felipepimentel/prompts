# Git Branch Naming Convention Guide

Our team needs a consistent branch naming convention. Please suggest a branch naming strategy that:
1. Clearly indicates the type of work (e.g., feature, bugfix, hotfix)
2. Includes relevant ticket or issue numbers
3. Is concise but descriptive

Provide examples for different scenarios and explain the rationale behind the suggested convention.
