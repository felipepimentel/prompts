Based on our discussion of the [component/system] architecture, can you help me create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)? Please include:
1. The context and problem we're addressing
2. The options we considered
3. The decision we made
4. The consequences (both positive and negative) of this decision
5. Any related decisions or trade-offs
