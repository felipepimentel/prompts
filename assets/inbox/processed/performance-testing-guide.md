<purpose>
To provide a structured approach for creating comprehensive performance test plans that effectively evaluate application performance under various conditions.
</purpose>

<context>
Use this guide when planning performance testing for applications, particularly when needing to evaluate scalability, response times, and resource utilization.
</context>

<instructions>
Create a performance test plan by addressing these key components:

1. Performance Metrics Definition
   - Response Time
     * Average response time
     * 95th percentile
     * Maximum response time
   - Throughput
     * Requests per second
     * Transactions per second
   - Resource Utilization
     * CPU usage
     * Memory consumption
     * Network bandwidth
     * Disk I/O

2. Test Scenarios Design
   - Load Testing
     * Normal load simulation
     * Peak hour simulation
     * Gradual load increase
   - Stress Testing
     * Maximum capacity testing
     * Breaking point identification
     * Recovery testing
   - Endurance Testing
     * Long-duration testing
     * Memory leak detection
     * Resource degradation analysis

3. Test Environment Setup
   - Hardware Requirements
   - Network Configuration
   - Monitoring Tools
   - Data Requirements
   - Test Data Generation

4. Tools and Frameworks Selection
   - Load Generation Tools
     * JMeter
     * Gatling
     * K6
   - Monitoring Tools
     * Grafana
     * Prometheus
     * New Relic
   - Log Analysis Tools

5. Bottleneck Identification Strategy
   - System Monitoring
   - Log Analysis
   - Performance Profiling
   - Database Query Analysis
   - Network Latency Testing

6. Results Analysis Framework
   - Data Collection
   - Metrics Visualization
   - Threshold Validation
   - Trend Analysis
   - Report Generation

<examples>
Example 1:
Input: E-commerce website checkout process
Output:
```yaml
Test Scenario: Checkout Performance
Metrics:
  - Cart addition time: < 500ms
  - Payment processing: < 2s
  - Order confirmation: < 1s
Load Pattern:
  - Normal: 100 concurrent users
  - Peak: 500 concurrent users
  - Stress: 1000+ concurrent users
Monitoring:
  - API response times
  - Database query times
  - Payment gateway latency
```

Example 2:
Input: API endpoint performance testing
Output:
```yaml
Test Scenario: API Endpoints
Metrics:
  - GET requests: < 100ms
  - POST requests: < 200ms
  - Batch operations: < 1s
Load Pattern:
  - Baseline: 50 req/s
  - Peak: 200 req/s
  - Stress: 500 req/s
Monitoring:
  - Response times
  - Error rates
  - Resource utilization
```
</examples>

<notes>
- Align test scenarios with business requirements
- Consider different user behaviors and patterns
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Document all assumptions and limitations
- Plan for result analysis and reporting
- Consider security implications of testing
- Ensure proper test data management
