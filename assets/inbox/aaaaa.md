I'm looking to improve the overall performance of my database. Here's an overview:
- Database system: [e.g., PostgreSQL 13]
- Current size: [e.g., 500GB]
- Main tables and their sizes: [List main tables]
- Common query patterns: [Describe typical queries]
- Current pain points: [e.g., slow joins on large tables, poor write performance during peak hours]

Please provide a comprehensive performance tuning plan, including:
1. Configuration parameters that might need adjustment
2. Indexing strategy review
3. Query optimization techniques
4. Potential schema optimizations
5. Caching strategies
6. Any other relevant suggestions for improving performance
For each suggestion, please explain the expected impact and any potential trade-offs.
