I need to create integration tests for the following components:
[List components and their interactions]

Please suggest a set of integration tests that:
1. Cover the main interaction scenarios between these components
2. Test for proper error handling and edge cases
3. Include any necessary setup and teardown procedures

Provide the test scenarios in a clear, step-by-step format, and include any necessary mock objects or test data.
