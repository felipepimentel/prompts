Using the component breakdown we've created, can you help me develop a project roadmap? Please include:
1. A suggested order for developing the components
2. Estimated time frames for each component (assuming I'm working on this part-time)
3. Potential milestones or checkpoints
4. Any dependencies between components that might affect the development order
5. Suggestions for any proof-of-concept or prototype stages that might be beneficial
