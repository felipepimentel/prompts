Thank you for that initial design. I have a few follow-up questions:
1. What are the potential drawbacks or limitations of this approach?
2. Can you suggest an alternative design that prioritizes [specific concern, e.g., performance, flexibility]?
3. How would this design need to change if we needed to [potential future requirement]?
