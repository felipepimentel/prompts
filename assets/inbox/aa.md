I need to migrate data from an old schema to a new one:
Old schema:
[Paste old schema]

New schema:
[Paste new schema]

Please help me create a migration plan:
1. Identify the steps needed to transform the data
2. Suggest any intermediate tables or views that might be helpful
3. Consider data integrity and how to handle potential conflicts
4. Propose a strategy to verify the migration's success
