# Agent Prompt Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the agent prompts in the `/prompts/developer/cursor/agents` directory. The changes focus on better structure, clearer documentation, and improved prompt engineering practices.

## File Organization and Naming Conventions

### File Renaming Strategy
The following files were renamed for better clarity and consistency:

1. `lintin.md` → `linting-directives.md`
   - More descriptive name
   - Better reflects the content focus on linting directives

2. `lintin-compose.md` → `linting-compose-rules.md`
   - Clearer indication of compose-specific rules
   - Maintains consistency with other linting files

3. `env-parameters.md` → `environment-parameters.md`
   - Full word usage for better clarity
   - Consistent with documentation standards

4. `strategic-lint.md` → `linting-strategy.md`
   - Better reflects the strategic nature of the content
   - Maintains naming consistency

5. `yolo.md` → `yolo-agent.md`
   - Clearer indication of agent-specific content
   - Better searchability

## Content Improvements

### 1. Technical Documentation
- Added comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- Improved code examples with practical implementations
- Enhanced error handling patterns
- Added performance optimization guidelines
- Included security best practices

### 2. Agent Interface Improvements
```typescript
interface AgentInterface {
  metadata: {
    agent_id: string;
    version: string;
    capabilities: string[];
  };
  
  behavior: {
    decision_logic: string;
    state_management: string;
    error_handling: string;
  };
  
  metrics: {
    performance: {
      responseTime: number;
      accuracy: number;
      efficiency: number;
    };
    quality: {
      codeQuality: number;
      testCoverage: number;
    };
  };
}
```

### 3. Workflow Integration
```yaml
workflow_integration:
  stages:
    - planning:
        - context_analysis
        - requirement_gathering
    - implementation:
        - code_generation
        - quality_checks
    - validation:
        - security_scan
        - performance_test
```
