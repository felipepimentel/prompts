| Technique | Purpose | Key Feature | Use Cases |
|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Zero-shot prompting | Direct model response without examples. | Relies on pre-trained knowledge. | Simple Q&A, general tasks. |
| Few-shot prompting | Guides model with a few examples. | Improves contextual understanding. | Sentiment analysis, classification. |
| Chain-of-thought prompting | Encourages step-by-step reasoning. | Solves logical, multi-step problems. | Math, logical reasoning, data interpretation. |
| Instruction-based prompting | Focuses the model on specific tasks. | Clear commands for optimized responses. | Task-specific outputs, content generation. |
| Role-based prompting | Assigns a role to guide response tone/content. | Shapes the response style. | Teaching, professional content. |
| Contextual prompting | Builds context progressively. | Supplies background information for nuanced responses. | Long-form generation, detailed tasks. |
| Meta prompting | Guides the model to design/refine prompts. | Prompts about creating prompts. | Automation of prompt creation. |
| Self-consistency prompting | Selects the most consistent output. | Majority voting for reliability. | Tasks with definitive answers. |
| Generated knowledge prompting | Generates intermediate context before answering. | Encourages preparatory thinking. | Step-by-step guides, context-heavy tasks. |
| Dynamic prompt optimization | Adjusts prompts in real-time. | Refines outputs during interactions. | Adaptive workflows, iterative tasks. |
| Automatic prompt engineering | Programmatically generates/refines prompts. | Reduces manual effort at scale. | Large-scale applications. |
| Multi-prompt fusion | Combines multiple prompts for balance. | Addresses competing priorities in outputs. | Creative + factual tasks. |
| Prompt chaining | Structures interdependent steps. | Output of one prompt becomes input for another. | Document analysis, process workflows. |
| Directional stimulus prompting | Guides tone/behavior with subtle cues. | Provides influence without explicit commands. | Style-guided generation, targeted writing. |
| Graph prompting | Structures relationships in graph format. | Helps interpret dependencies and hierarchies. | Network analysis, relational data. |
