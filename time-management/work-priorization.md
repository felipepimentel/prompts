I need assistance in prioritizing my tasks for the day. I have a list of tasks that need to be completed, but I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. 

Your task is to review the list of tasks and help me determine which ones are the most urgent and important. Provide a suggested order in which I should tackle each task, taking into consideration deadlines, importance, and any dependencies between tasks.
