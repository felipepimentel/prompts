I need assistance in setting achievable and realistic goals for the day. The goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART goals) to ensure that I stay focused and productive throughout the day.

Your task is to work with me to identify tasks that need to be completed and prioritize them based on their importance and urgency. Together, we will create a plan of action with clear and actionable steps to help me accomplish my goals for the day.
