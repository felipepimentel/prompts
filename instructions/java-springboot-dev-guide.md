# Project Development and Management Guide

## 1. Project Initialization
- Set up Spring Boot project structure
- Configure Shiro for security framework
- Integrate Mybatis-Plus as ORM
- Set up Flowable for workflow management

## 2. Database Design
- Design database schema
- Implement ShardingSphere for read/write splitting and sharding
- Create necessary tables for Flowable workflows

## 3. Code Generation
- Use built-in code generator for:
  - Controllers
  - Services
  - DAOs
  - Entities
  - Vue components
- Customize generated code as needed

## 4. Implement Core Functionalities
- Develop services using CrudService interface
- Implement dictionary management system
- Set up UReport2.0 for reporting needs
- Integrate EasyExcel for import/export functions

## 5. Security Implementation
- Configure Shiro security policies
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints

## 6. Workflow Development
- Design and implement Flowable workflows
- Integrate workflows with business processes

## 7. Frontend Development
- Develop Vue.js components
- Integrate with backend APIs
- Implement responsive design

## 8. Testing
- Write unit tests for services and controllers
- Perform integration testing
- Conduct user acceptance testing

## 9. Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries using Mybatis-Plus
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Fine-tune ShardingSphere configuration

## 10. Documentation
- Write API documentation
- Create user manuals
- Document database schema and relationships

## 11. Deployment
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure production environment
- Plan for data migration (if applicable)

## 12. Maintenance and Updates
- Monitor system performance
- Address bug reports
- Plan and implement new features

Remember:
- Regularly commit code and push to version control
- Conduct code reviews before merging into main branch
- Keep libraries and dependencies up to date
- Regularly back up the database
- Document any major decisions or changes in the project

Always strive to write secure, performant, and maintainable code. Provide explanations for your design choices and any potential optimizations. Adapt the steps as necessary to fit the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

When using this guide, always consider the specific requirements and constraints of your project. Adapt the steps as necessary to fit your team's workflow and the project's needs.
