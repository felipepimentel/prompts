# Code Review Guidelines

## 1. Prepare for the Review
- Ensure all tests are passing
- Review your own code first
- Provide context in the pull request description

## 2. What to Look For
### 2.1 Code Quality
- Is the code clear and easy to understand?
- Does it follow the project's coding standards?
- Are there any overly complex parts that could be simplified?

### 2.2 Functionality
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are all edge cases handled?
- Is there proper error handling?

### 2.3 Performance
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Could any operations be optimized?

### 2.4 Security
- Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data properly protected?

### 2.5 Testing
- Are there adequate unit tests?
- Do the tests cover critical paths and edge cases?

## 3. How to Comment
- Be specific and clear in your feedback
- Explain your reasoning
- Suggest improvements, don't just point out problems
- Use a constructive and respectful tone

## 4. Responding to Reviews
- Thank reviewers for their time and input
- Respond to every comment
- Be open to feedback and willing to make changes
- If you disagree, explain your reasoning politely

## 5. When to Approve
- The code functions as intended
- It follows the project's coding standards
- There are no major design issues
- Adequate tests are in place

## 6. After the Review
- Make the agreed-upon changes
- Re-request review if significant changes were made
- Update documentation if necessary

## 7. Best Practices
- Review in multiple passes (e.g., functionality first, then style)
- Don't review for more than 60-90 minutes at a time
- If a review is too large, request that it be broken down

Remember: The goal of code review is to improve code quality and share knowledge, not to criticize the developer. Always approach reviews with a collaborative mindset.
