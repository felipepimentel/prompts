## Sequence Framework

### 1. Story Structure
```yaml
narrative_flow:
  beginning:
    setup: "[SETUP]"
    introduction: ["[SCENE1]", "[SCENE2]"]
    
  middle:
    development: ["[DEV1]", "[DEV2]"]
    challenges: ["[CHAL1]", "[CHAL2]"]
    
  end:
    resolution: "[RESOLUTION]"
    conclusion: "[CONCLUSION]"
```

### 2. Visual Elements
```yaml
design_components:
  composition:
    layouts: ["[LAYOUT1]", "[LAYOUT2]"]
    focal_points: ["[FOCUS1]", "[FOCUS2]"]
    
  style_elements:
    patterns: ["[PATTERN1]", "[PATTERN2]"]
    textures: ["[TEXTURE1]", "[TEXTURE2]"]
    
  transitions:
    connections: ["[CONN1]", "[CONN2]"]
    flow_elements: ["[ELEM1]", "[ELEM2]"]
```

### 3. Coloring Considerations
```yaml
coloring_aspects:
  complexity:
    detail_levels: ["[LEVEL1]", "[LEVEL2]"]
    space_distribution: "[DISTRIBUTION]"
    
  techniques:
    pattern_types: ["[TYPE1]", "[TYPE2]"]
    texture_variety: ["[VAR1]", "[VAR2]"]
```

## Development Methods

sequence_specification:
  overview:
    story_arc: "[ARC]"
    style_guide: "[STYLE]"
    page_count: "[COUNT]"
    
  scenes:
    - page: "[NUMBER]"
      description: "[DESCRIPTION]"
      elements: ["[ELEM1]", "[ELEM2]"]
      focus: "[FOCUS]"
      
    - page: "[NUMBER]"
      description: "[DESCRIPTION]"
      elements: ["[ELEM1]", "[ELEM2]"]
      focus: "[FOCUS]"
      
  transitions:
    visual_links: ["[LINK1]", "[LINK2]"]
    flow_elements: ["[ELEM1]", "[ELEM2]"]
    
  coloring_guide:
