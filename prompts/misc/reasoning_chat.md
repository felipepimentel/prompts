  evaluation:
    strengths: ["[STR1]", "[STR2]"]
    challenges: ["[CHAL1]", "[CHAL2]"]
```

### 3. Response Strategy
```yaml
response_elements:
  approach:
    method: "[METHOD]"
    rationale: "[RATIONALE]"
    adaptations: ["[ADAPT1]", "[ADAPT2]"]
    
  components:
    key_messages: ["[MSG1]", "[MSG2]"]
    supporting_points: ["[POINT1]", "[POINT2]"]
    
  delivery:
    tone: "[TONE]"
    style: "[STYLE]"
    pacing: "[PACING]"
```
