# Framework Integration Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Architectural Foundations
- Modularity and loose coupling
- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- Interface-driven design
- Dependency injection

### 2. Integration Patterns
```yaml
integration_patterns:
  workflow_chains:
    prompt_to_tool:
      input: "Structured prompt"
      processing: "Tool selection"
      output: "Execution sequence"
      validation: "Feasibility check"
    
    tool_to_analysis:
      input: "Tool results"
      processing: "Analysis framework"
      output: "Processed insights"
      validation: "Quality metrics"
    
    analysis_to_documentation:
      input: "Analysis results"
      processing: "Documentation framework"
      output: "Structured documentation"
      validation: "Completeness check"

  cross_framework_communication:
    data_formats:
      - type: "Prompt templates"
        format: "YAML/JSON"
        validation: "Schema-based"
      
      - type: "Tool configurations"
        format: "JSON"
        validation: "Runtime"
      
      - type: "Analysis results"
        format: "Structured data"
        validation: "Type-based"
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
```yaml
quality_framework:
  validation_levels:
    framework_specific:
      checks:
        - "Internal consistency"
        - "Standards compliance"
        - "Performance benchmarks"
        - "Security validation"
    
    integration:
      checks:
        - "Cross-framework compatibility"
        - "Data flow integrity"
        - "Error propagation"
        - "State management"
    
    system:
      checks:
        - "End-to-end functionality"
        - "Performance impact"
        - "Resource utilization"
        - "Scalability assessment"
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Framework Selection
1. Identify primary task categories
2. Evaluate framework compatibility
3. Map integration points
4. Plan execution sequences
5. Define monitoring strategies

### 2. Integration Setup
1. Configure shared context
2. Establish communication channels
3. Implement validation rules
4. Set up error handling
5. Deploy monitoring systems

### 3. Workflow Management
1. Design workflow chains
2. Configure event triggers
3. Implement feedback loops
4. Monitor performance
5. Document processes

## Best Practices

### 1. Development Standards
```yaml
development_practices:
  code_standards:
    principles:
      - "Clean code methodology"
      - "SOLID principles"
      - "DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)"
      - "KISS (Keep It Simple)"
    
  review_process:
    methods:
      - "Automated checks"
      - "Peer review"
      - "Architecture review"
      - "Security assessment"
    
  documentation:
    requirements:
      - "API documentation"
      - "Integration guides"
      - "Architecture diagrams"
      - "Troubleshooting guides"
```

### 2. Maintenance Strategy
```yaml
maintenance_approach:
  routine:
    activities:
      - "Framework updates"
      - "Integration testing"
      - "Performance optimization"
      - "Documentation updates"
    frequency: "Monthly"
    
  incident_response:
    steps:
      - "Issue detection"
      - "Impact assessment"
      - "Resolution planning"
      - "Implementation"
      - "Validation"
    priority: "Risk-based"
```

## Common Integration Scenarios

### 1. Content Generation Pipeline
```yaml
content_pipeline:
  steps:
    requirement_analysis:
      framework: "Prompt Engineering"
      output: "Structured requirements"
    
    tool_selection:
      framework: "Tool Selection"
      output: "Execution plan"
    
    content_creation:
      framework: "Multiple"
      output: "Draft content"
    
    quality_check:
      framework: "Analysis"
      output: "Validation report"
```

### 2. Data Processing Workflow
```yaml
data_workflow:
  stages:
    data_collection:
      frameworks: ["Tool Selection", "Data Analysis"]
      integration: "Automated pipeline"
    
    processing:
      frameworks: ["Analysis", "Documentation"]
      integration: "Result formatting"
    
    reporting:
      frameworks: ["Documentation", "Visualization"]
      integration: "Template-based"
```

### 3. System Integration
```yaml
integration_workflow:
  components:
    development:
      frameworks: ["Development", "Tool Selection"]
      purpose: "Component creation"
    
    testing:
      frameworks: ["Testing", "Quality"]
      purpose: "Integration validation"
    
    documentation:
      frameworks: ["Documentation", "Quality"]
      purpose: "Integration docs"
```
