# Clean Code Guidelines

## Overview
Writing clean code is essential for creating maintainable, readable, and efficient software. As Martin Fowler states, "Anybody can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

## What is Clean Code?
Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Popularized by Robert Cecil Martin ("Uncle Bob") in his book "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship", it emphasizes principles and practices that lead to better software craftsmanship.

## Why Clean Code Matters

### 1. Readability and Maintenance
- Makes code easier to understand and modify
- Reduces time needed to grasp functionality
- Leads to faster development cycles

### 2. Team Collaboration
- Facilitates communication between team members
- Makes it easier to understand others' work
- Enables effective collaboration

### 3. Debugging and Issue Resolution
- Makes it easier to locate and fix issues
- Simplifies troubleshooting process
- Reduces debugging time

### 4. Quality and Reliability
- Reduces risk of errors
- Leads to higher quality software
- Improves long-term reliability

## Core Principles

### 1. Avoid Hard-Coded Numbers
```python
# ❌ Bad: Hard-coded values
def calculate_discount(price):
    discount = price * 0.1  # 10% discount
    return price - discount

# ✅ Good: Named constants
def calculate_discount(price):
    TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1
    discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT
    return price - discount
```

### 2. Use Meaningful Names
```python
# ❌ Bad: Ambiguous names
def calc_disc(p):
    d = p * 0.1
    return p - d

# ✅ Good: Descriptive names
def calculate_product_discount(product_price):
    discount_amount = product_price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT
    return product_price - discount_amount
```

### 3. Write Focused Functions
```python
# ❌ Bad: Multiple responsibilities
def process_data(data):
    # Validate users
    # Calculate values
    # Format output
    pass

# ✅ Good: Single responsibility
def validate_user(data):
    # Validation logic
    pass

def calculate_values(data):
    # Calculation logic
    pass

def format_output(data):
    # Formatting logic
    pass
```

### 4. Follow DRY Principle
```python
# ❌ Bad: Duplicated logic
def calculate_book_price(quantity, price):
    return quantity * price

def calculate_laptop_price(quantity, price):
    return quantity * price

# ✅ Good: Reusable function
def calculate_product_price(product_quantity, product_price):
    return product_quantity * product_price
```

### 5. Encapsulate Conditionals
```python
# ❌ Bad: Nested conditionals
def calculate_discount(price):
    if price > 100:
        return price * 0.1
    elif price > 50:
        return price * 0.05
    return 0

# ✅ Good: Encapsulated logic
def get_discount_rate(price):
    if price > 100:
        return 0.1
    elif price > 50:
        return 0.05
    return 0

def calculate_discount(price):
    return price * get_discount_rate(price)
```

## Coding Standards

### Python
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Indent with 4 spaces
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines

### JavaScript
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Follow Google JavaScript Style Guide

### Java
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPERCASE for constants
- Indent with 4 spaces
- Follow Oracle Java Style Guide

## Documentation Guidelines

### Comments
```python
# ❌ Bad: Redundant comments
def group_users_by_id(user_id):
    # This function groups users by id
    pass

# ✅ Good: Meaningful documentation
def group_users_by_id(user_id):
    """Groups users by id to a specific category (1-9).
    
    Args:
        user_id (str): The user id to be grouped.
    
    Returns:
        int: The category number (1-9).
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If user id is invalid.
    """
    pass
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization
- Keep files focused and manageable
- Group related functionality
- Maintain consistent structure

### 2. Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Review changes before committing

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Refactor regularly
- Address technical debt
- Leave code better than you found it
