# Development Framework Integration Guide

## Context
This guide outlines the integration patterns and relationships between various development frameworks, including Tool Selection, Code Review, Documentation, and Testing frameworks. The goal is to provide a unified approach to software development and maintenance.

## Framework Ecosystem

### 1. Core Frameworks
```yaml
framework_hierarchy:
  development:
    primary: "Development Framework"
    purpose: "Code creation and management"
    integration_points: [
      "Tool selection",
      "Code generation",
      "Quality assurance"
    ]
    
  quality_assurance:
    primary: "Testing Framework"
    purpose: "Code quality and reliability"
    integration_points: [
      "Unit testing",
      "Integration testing",
      "Performance testing"
    ]
    
  documentation:
    primary: "Documentation Framework"
    purpose: "Knowledge management"
    integration_points: [
      "Code documentation",
      "API documentation",
      "User guides"
    ]
```

### 2. Integration Patterns
```yaml
workflow_patterns:
  development_pipeline:
    planning_to_development:
      input: "Requirements"
      processing: "Tool selection framework"
      output: "Development plan"
      validation: "Feasibility check"
    
    development_to_testing:
      input: "Code changes"
      processing: "Testing framework"
      output: "Test results"
      validation: "Quality metrics"
    
    testing_to_documentation:
      input: "Validated code"
      processing: "Documentation framework"
      output: "Updated docs"
      validation: "Completeness check"

  cross_framework_communication:
    code_formats:
      - type: "Source code"
        format: "Language-specific"
        validation: "Linting"
      
      - type: "Test code"
        format: "Test framework"
        validation: "Coverage"
      
      - type: "Documentation"
        format: "Markdown/API spec"
        validation: "Completeness"
```

### 3. Quality Gates
```yaml
quality_framework:
  code_quality:
    metrics: [
      "Code coverage",
      "Complexity",
      "Duplication",
      "Style compliance"
    ]
    thresholds:
      coverage: "80% minimum"
      complexity: "15 maximum"
    
  test_quality:
    metrics: [
      "Test coverage",
      "Test reliability",
      "Performance benchmarks"
    ]
    validation:
      methods: [
        "Automated testing",
        "Code review",
        "Performance testing"
      ]
    
  documentation_quality:
    metrics: [
      "Completeness",
      "Accuracy",
      "Clarity"
    ]
    validation:
      methods: [
        "Peer review",
        "Automated checks",
        "User feedback"
      ]
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Framework Selection
1. Assess project requirements
2. Choose development stack
3. Select testing frameworks
4. Plan documentation approach
5. Configure tooling

### 2. Integration Setup
1. Configure CI/CD pipeline
2. Set up testing environment
3. Establish documentation workflow
4. Configure monitoring
5. Set up reporting

### 3. Workflow Management
1. Design development flow
2. Implement code reviews
3. Configure automated tests
4. Set up documentation generation
5. Monitor quality metrics

## Best Practices

### 1. Development Standards
```yaml
development_practices:
  code_standards:
    principles: [
      "Clean code",
      "SOLID principles",
      "DRY principle",
      "KISS principle"
    ]
    
  review_process:
    methods: [
      "Automated checks",
      "Peer review",
      "Architecture review",
      "Security review"
    ]
    
  documentation:
    requirements: [
      "Code comments",
      "API documentation",
      "Architecture docs",
      "User guides"
    ]
```

### 2. Testing Strategy
```yaml
testing_strategy:
  levels:
    unit:
      scope: "Individual components"
      tools: ["Jest", "JUnit", "PyTest"]
      automation: "Continuous"
    
    integration:
      scope: "Component interaction"
      tools: ["TestContainers", "Integration suites"]
      frequency: "Per PR"
    
    system:
      scope: "End-to-end functionality"
      tools: ["Selenium", "Cypress", "Playwright"]
      frequency: "Daily"
```

### 3. Documentation Standards
```yaml
documentation_standards:
  code_documentation:
    requirements: [
      "Function documentation",
      "Class documentation",
      "Module documentation"
    ]
    
  api_documentation:
    standards: [
      "OpenAPI specification",
      "API examples",
      "Error documentation"
    ]
    
  user_documentation:
    components: [
      "Installation guide",
      "User manual",
      "Troubleshooting guide"
    ]
```

## Common Integration Scenarios

      frameworks: ["Tool Selection", "Documentation"]
      outputs: "Development plan"
    
    implementation:
      frameworks: ["Development", "Testing"]
      outputs: "Tested code"
    
    documentation:
      frameworks: ["Documentation", "Quality"]
      outputs: "Complete feature"
```

### 2. Maintenance Updates
```yaml

    implementation:
      frameworks: ["Development", "Testing"]
      integration: "Fixed code"
    
    verification:
      frameworks: ["Testing", "Documentation"]
      integration: "Validated fix"
```

### 3. System Integration
```yaml
integration_workflow:
  components:
    development:
      frameworks: ["Development", "Tool Selection"]
      purpose: "Component creation"
    
    testing:
      frameworks: ["Testing", "Quality"]
      purpose: "Integration validation"
    
    documentation:
