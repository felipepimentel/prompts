# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Precision
- Be specific about desired output format
- Define scope and constraints clearly
- Use unambiguous language
- Provide relevant context

### 2. Structure and Organization
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Use hierarchical organization
- Include examples when helpful
- Maintain logical flow

### 3. Context Management
- Provide necessary background
- Include relevant constraints
- Specify target audience
- Define technical requirements

## Prompt Components

### 1. Role Definition
```
You are an expert [ROLE] with deep experience in [DOMAIN].
Your task is to [PRIMARY_OBJECTIVE].
```

### 2. Task Description
```
Please [ACTION_VERB] the following [SUBJECT]:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Constraint 1
```

### 3. Output Format
```
Provide your response in the following format:
1. [SECTION_1]
   - Key points
   - Details
2. [SECTION_2]
   - Analysis
   - Recommendations
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Input Formatting
- Use clear section headers
- Include relevant examples
- Specify input constraints
- Define expected format

### 2. Output Control
- Define response structure
- Specify level of detail
- Include format templates
- Set quality criteria

### 3. Error Handling
- Anticipate edge cases
- Provide fallback options
- Include validation rules
- Define error responses

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought
```
Think through this step-by-step:
1. First, consider [ASPECT_1]
2. Then, analyze [ASPECT_2]
3. Finally, conclude with [ASPECT_3]
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning
```
Example 1:
Input: [SAMPLE_INPUT_1]
Output: [SAMPLE_OUTPUT_1]

Example 2:
Input: [SAMPLE_INPUT_2]
Output: [SAMPLE_OUTPUT_2]

Now, process this:
Input: [ACTUAL_INPUT]
```

### 3. Role-Based Prompting
```
You are a [ROLE] with expertise in [DOMAIN].
Your audience is [TARGET_AUDIENCE].
Your goal is to [OBJECTIVE].
Consider these aspects:
1. [ASPECT_1]
2. [ASPECT_2]
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Analysis Template
```
Analyze this [SUBJECT] considering:
1. Context
   - Background
   - Requirements
2. Key Components
   - Element 1
   - Element 2
3. Recommendations
   - Short-term
   - Long-term
```

### 2. Generation Template
```
Create a [OUTPUT_TYPE] that:
1. Meets these requirements:
   - [REQUIREMENT_1]
   - [REQUIREMENT_2]
2. Follows these constraints:
   - [CONSTRAINT_1]
   - [CONSTRAINT_2]
3. Includes these elements:
   - [ELEMENT_1]
   - [ELEMENT_2]
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Validation Criteria
- Accuracy of output
- Completeness of response
- Adherence to format
- Relevance to task

### 2. Iteration Process
1. Test prompt with sample inputs
2. Analyze response quality
3. Refine prompt based on results
4. Repeat until satisfactory

## Best Practices Summary

1. Be explicit and specific
2. Provide clear context
3. Define output format
4. Include examples
5. Consider edge cases
6. Test and iterate
7. Document assumptions

Remember: Effective prompt engineering is iterative and requires careful consideration of both the model's capabilities and the user's needs.
