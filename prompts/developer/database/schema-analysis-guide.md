prompt_type: "Analysis Framework"
---

<purpose>
To provide a structured framework for analyzing database schemas and suggesting improvements for better performance, scalability, and data integrity.
</purpose>

<context>
Use this prompt when reviewing database schemas to ensure they follow best practices and are optimized for the intended use case.
</context>

<instructions>
Given this initial schema:
[Paste your schema here]

Please analyze the schema considering these key aspects:

1. Normalization Analysis
   - Evaluate current normalization level
   - Identify potential normalization issues
   - Suggest improvements for proper normalization
   - Consider impact on data consistency

2. Performance Optimization
   - Identify candidates for strategic denormalization
   - Analyze query patterns and access patterns
   - Suggest performance improvements
   - Consider read vs write operation balance

3. Indexing Strategy
   - Review existing indexes
   - Suggest additional beneficial indexes
   - Consider impact on write performance
   - Analyze query patterns for index usage

4. Scalability Assessment
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Analyze growth patterns and limitations
   - Suggest partitioning strategies if needed
   - Consider distributed database options

5. Data Integrity Measures
   - Review existing constraints
   - Suggest additional constraints or triggers
   - Consider referential integrity
   - Evaluate consistency requirements

For each suggestion, provide:
- Detailed explanation of the improvement
- Pros and cons of implementation
- Impact on existing operations
- Implementation considerations
</instructions>

<variables>
- schema: The database schema to analyze
- use_case: Primary use case and requirements
- scale: Expected scale and growth patterns
- performance_requirements: Specific performance needs
</variables>

<examples>
Example 1:
Input: E-commerce product catalog schema
Output: Analysis focusing on product variation handling, category hierarchies, and inventory tracking

Example 2:
Input: Social media user interaction schema
Output: Analysis emphasizing relationship modeling, activity tracking, and data partitioning
</examples>

<notes>
- Consider both immediate and long-term implications
- Balance between normalization and performance
- Account for specific database engine features
- Consider maintenance and operational aspects
- Document assumptions and trade-offs
