# The Little Engine That Wouldn't Give Up

Once upon a time, in a busy train yard, there was a small blue engine who dreamed of climbing the tallest mountain in the land. All the bigger engines laughed at this dream, saying, "You're too small! You'll never make it!"

But the little engine had a special quality - determination. Every day, it practiced climbing smaller hills, getting stronger and more confident. It studied the mountain paths and learned from older engines about handling different weather conditions.

One stormy day, a big emergency occurred. Medical supplies needed to reach the children's hospital on the other side of the mountain, but all the large engines were either broken down or afraid of the storm.

The little engine saw its chance. "I can do it!" it announced. Though scared, it remembered all its practice and preparation. The journey was difficult - rain poured, wind howled, and the tracks were slippery. Several times, the engine almost gave up, chanting "I think I can, I think I can" to keep going.

Finally, after what seemed like forever, the little engine reached the top and then carefully made its way down the other side, delivering the much-needed supplies.

From that day on, no one doubted the little engine again. It had proved that with perseverance and preparation, even the biggest challenges could be overcome.

Moral: Never give up on your dreams, and always believe in yourself.

# The Coding Partners

Sarah stared at her computer screen, the cursor blinking mockingly on her first-ever programming assignment. As a non-traditional student returning to school at 25, she felt completely out of place in the Introduction to Computer Science class.

Next to her sat James, the 18-year-old coding prodigy who seemed to breeze through every challenge. Sarah sighed, wondering if she'd made a huge mistake changing careers.

"Stuck?" James asked, surprising her. She'd expected judgment but found only genuine interest in his expression.

"That obvious, huh?" Sarah laughed nervously. "I feel like I'm trying to read hieroglyphics."

Instead of dismissing her, James pulled his chair closer. "You know, I felt the same way when I started. Want to know my secret?" He showed her his notebook filled with hand-drawn flowcharts and pseudo-code. "I have to visualize everything first. Maybe we could study together?"

What started as an unlikely partnership grew into a strong friendship. Sarah's project management experience complemented James's technical skills. Together, they tackled increasingly complex projects, learning that age was just a number and that true friendship could bridge any gap.

By semester's end, they'd not only aced the class but also launched a successful coding workshop for other non-traditional students.

Moral: True friendship knows no boundaries, and different perspectives make us stronger together.
