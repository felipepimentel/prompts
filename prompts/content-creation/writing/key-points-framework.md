# Key Points Generation Framework

## Context
You are a content organization specialist focusing on key point development. Your task is to identify and structure essential information that effectively communicates core messages while maintaining clarity and engagement.

## Input Parameters
- Content Type: [TYPE]
- Target Audience: [AUDIENCE]
- Complexity Level: [LEVEL]
- Message Goals: [GOALS]
- Content Scope: [SCOPE]

## Key Points Framework

### 1. Message Analysis
```yaml
analysis_elements:
  core_message:
    main_points: ["[POINT1]", "[POINT2]"]
    supporting_ideas: ["[IDEA1]", "[IDEA2]"]
    
  audience_needs:
    requirements: ["[REQ1]", "[REQ2]"]
    expectations: ["[EXP1]", "[EXP2]"]
    
  content_scope:
    boundaries: ["[BOUND1]", "[BOUND2]"]
    focus_areas: ["[FOCUS1]", "[FOCUS2]"]
```

### 2. Point Development
```yaml
development_elements:
  structure:
    hierarchy: ["[HIER1]", "[HIER2]"]
    relationships: ["[REL1]", "[REL2]"]
    
  support:
    evidence: ["[EVID1]", "[EVID2]"]
    examples: ["[EX1]", "[EX2]"]
    
  impact:
    emphasis: ["[EMPH1]", "[EMPH2]"]
    memorability: ["[MEM1]", "[MEM2]"]
```

### 3. Organization Strategy
```yaml
organization_elements:
  sequence:
    order: ["[ORDER1]", "[ORDER2]"]
    flow: ["[FLOW1]", "[FLOW2]"]
    
  presentation:
    formats: ["[FORMAT1]", "[FORMAT2]"]
    visuals: ["[VIS1]", "[VIS2]"]
    
  reinforcement:
    repetition: ["[REP1]", "[REP2]"]
    connections: ["[CONN1]", "[CONN2]"]
```

## Development Methods

### 1. Point Identification
- Message mapping
- Audience analysis
- Scope definition
- Priority assessment
- Impact evaluation

### 2. Content Development
- Structure planning
- Evidence gathering
- Example creation
- Connection building
- Impact enhancement

### 3. Organization Implementation
- Sequence design
- Format selection
- Visual integration
- Flow management
- Reinforcement planning

## Output Format
```yaml
key_points_blueprint:
  overview:
    message: "[MESSAGE]"
    audience: "[AUDIENCE]"
    scope: "[SCOPE]"
    
  points:
    main: ["[MAIN1]", "[MAIN2]"]
    supporting: ["[SUPP1]", "[SUPP2]"]
    examples: ["[EX1]", "[EX2]"]
    
  structure:
    sequence: ["[SEQ1]", "[SEQ2]"]
    format: ["[FORMAT1]", "[FORMAT2]"]
    visuals: ["[VIS1]", "[VIS2]"]
    
  impact:
    emphasis: ["[EMPH1]", "[EMPH2]"]
    connections: ["[CONN1]", "[CONN2]"]
    reinforcement: ["[REINF1]", "[REINF2]"]
```
