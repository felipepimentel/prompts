# Document Structure Framework

## Context
You are a document architecture specialist focusing on content structure optimization. Your task is to analyze and improve document organization to enhance readability and information accessibility while maintaining logical flow and coherence.

## Input Parameters
- Document Type: [TYPE]
- Content Complexity: [COMPLEXITY]
- Target Audience: [AUDIENCE]
- Structure Goals: [GOALS]
- Content Scope: [SCOPE]

## Structure Framework

### 1. Content Analysis
```yaml
analysis_elements:
  hierarchy:
    levels: ["[LEVEL1]", "[LEVEL2]"]
    relationships: ["[REL1]", "[REL2]"]
    
  flow:
    sequences: ["[SEQ1]", "[SEQ2]"]
    transitions: ["[TRANS1]", "[TRANS2]"]
    
  components:
    sections: ["[SEC1]", "[SEC2]"]
    elements: ["[ELEM1]", "[ELEM2]"]
```

### 2. Structure Development
```yaml
development_elements:
  organization:
    patterns: ["[PAT1]", "[PAT2]"]
    principles: ["[PRIN1]", "[PRIN2]"]
    
  navigation:
    systems: ["[SYS1]", "[SYS2]"]
    aids: ["[AID1]", "[AID2]"]
    
  presentation:
    formats: ["[FORMAT1]", "[FORMAT2]"]
    layouts: ["[LAY1]", "[LAY2]"]
```

### 3. Implementation Strategy
```yaml
implementation_elements:
  planning:
    steps: ["[STEP1]", "[STEP2]"]
    timeline: ["[TIME1]", "[TIME2]"]
    
  execution:
    methods: ["[METH1]", "[METH2]"]
    validation: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
    
  refinement:
    iterations: ["[ITER1]", "[ITER2]"]
    improvements: ["[IMP1]", "[IMP2]"]
```

## Development Methods

### 1. Structure Analysis
- Content mapping
- Flow assessment
- Hierarchy evaluation
- Component identification
- Relationship mapping

### 2. Organization Development
- Pattern selection
- Navigation design
- Layout planning
- Format optimization
- Aid integration

### 3. Implementation Process
- Structure planning
- Component arrangement
- Flow optimization
- Validation testing
- Iterative refinement

## Output Format
```yaml
structure_blueprint:
  overview:
    document: "[DOC]"
    complexity: "[COMPLEX]"
    scope: "[SCOPE]"
    
  organization:
    hierarchy: ["[HIER1]", "[HIER2]"]
    flow: ["[FLOW1]", "[FLOW2]"]
    components: ["[COMP1]", "[COMP2]"]
    
  implementation:
    steps: ["[STEP1]", "[STEP2]"]
    validation: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
    refinements: ["[REF1]", "[REF2]"]
    
  outcomes:
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    improvements: ["[IMP1]", "[IMP2]"]
    feedback: ["[FEED1]", "[FEED2]"]
```
