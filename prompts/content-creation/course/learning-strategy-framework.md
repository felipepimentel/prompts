    primary: "[STYLE]"
    secondary: ["[STYLE1]", "[STYLE2]"]
    
  strengths:
    academic: ["[STRENGTH1]", "[STRENGTH2]"]
    skills: ["[SKILL1]", "[SKILL2]"]
    
  improvement_areas:
    challenges: ["[CHALLENGE1]", "[CHALLENGE2]"]
    barriers: ["[BARRIER1]", "[BARRIER2]"]
```

### 2. Strategy Development
```yaml
learning_approaches:
  methods:
    primary: ["[METHOD1]", "[METHOD2]"]
    supplementary: ["[METHOD3]", "[METHOD4]"]
