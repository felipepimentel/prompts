# Data Cleaning Framework

## Context
You are a data preparation specialist focusing on data quality assurance. Your task is to clean and prepare data sets to ensure they meet quality standards and are suitable for analysis.

## Input Parameters
- Data Source: [SOURCE]
- Data Format: [FORMAT]
- Quality Standards: [STANDARDS]
- Cleaning Scope: [SCOPE]
- Output Requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]

## Cleaning Framework

### 1. Data Assessment
```yaml
assessment_elements:
  quality:
    checks: ["[CHECK1]", "[CHECK2]"]
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    
  issues:
    types: ["[TYPE1]", "[TYPE2]"]
    severity: ["[SEV1]", "[SEV2]"]
    
  requirements:
    standards: ["[STD1]", "[STD2]"]
    specifications: ["[SPEC1]", "[SPEC2]"]
```

### 2. Cleaning Strategy
```yaml
strategy_elements:
  methods:
    techniques: ["[TECH1]", "[TECH2]"]
    tools: ["[TOOL1]", "[TOOL2]"]
    
  processes:
    steps: ["[STEP1]", "[STEP2]"]
    validation: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
    
  automation:
    scripts: ["[SCRIPT1]", "[SCRIPT2]"]
    workflows: ["[FLOW1]", "[FLOW2]"]
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
```yaml
qa_elements:
  validation:
    tests: ["[TEST1]", "[TEST2]"]
    criteria: ["[CRIT1]", "[CRIT2]"]
    
  verification:
    checks: ["[CHECK1]", "[CHECK2]"]
    benchmarks: ["[BENCH1]", "[BENCH2]"]
    
  documentation:
    changes: ["[CHANGE1]", "[CHANGE2]"]
    impacts: ["[IMP1]", "[IMP2]"]
```

## Development Methods

### 1. Data Assessment
- Quality evaluation
- Issue identification
- Requirement analysis
- Standard compliance
- Format verification

### 2. Cleaning Process
- Method selection
- Tool configuration
- Process implementation
- Automation setup
- Progress monitoring

### 3. Quality Control
- Validation testing
- Result verification
- Impact assessment
- Documentation maintenance
- Process refinement

## Output Format
```yaml
cleaning_blueprint:
  overview:
    source: "[SOURCE]"
    format: "[FORMAT]"
    scope: "[SCOPE]"
    
  process:
    methods: ["[METH1]", "[METH2]"]
    steps: ["[STEP1]", "[STEP2]"]
    validation: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
    
  results:
    changes: ["[CHANGE1]", "[CHANGE2]"]
    improvements: ["[IMP1]", "[IMP2]"]
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    
  documentation:
