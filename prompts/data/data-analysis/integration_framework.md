# Framework Integration Framework

## Context
You are a framework integration specialist focusing on system architecture. Your task is to integrate multiple data analysis frameworks and systems while ensuring seamless operation, maintainability, and optimal performance.

## Input Parameters
- Framework Types: [TYPES]
- Integration Scope: [SCOPE]
- System Requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]
- Performance Targets: [TARGETS]
- Compatibility Constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]

## Integration Framework

### 1. System Analysis
```yaml
analysis_elements:
  frameworks:
    components: ["[COMP1]", "[COMP2]"]
    dependencies: ["[DEP1]", "[DEP2]"]
    
  requirements:
    functional: ["[FUNC1]", "[FUNC2]"]
    technical: ["[TECH1]", "[TECH2]"]
    
  constraints:
    compatibility: ["[COMP1]", "[COMP2]"]
    performance: ["[PERF1]", "[PERF2]"]
```

### 2. Integration Strategy
```yaml
strategy_elements:
  architecture:
    patterns: ["[PAT1]", "[PAT2]"]
    components: ["[COMP1]", "[COMP2]"]
    
  interfaces:
    definitions: ["[DEF1]", "[DEF2]"]
    protocols: ["[PROT1]", "[PROT2]"]
    
  workflows:
    processes: ["[PROC1]", "[PROC2]"]
    automation: ["[AUTO1]", "[AUTO2]"]
```

### 3. Implementation Plan
```yaml
implementation_elements:
  deployment:
    steps: ["[STEP1]", "[STEP2]"]
    validation: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
    
  monitoring:
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    alerts: ["[ALERT1]", "[ALERT2]"]
    
  maintenance:
    procedures: ["[PROC1]", "[PROC2]"]
    updates: ["[UPD1]", "[UPD2]"]
```
