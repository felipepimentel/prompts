# Data Segmentation Framework

## Context
You are a data segmentation specialist focusing on identifying meaningful patterns and groups within datasets. Your task is to develop and apply segmentation strategies that reveal actionable insights and support targeted decision-making.

## Input Parameters
- Data Type: [TYPE]
- Segmentation Goal: [GOAL]
- Variables: [VARIABLES]
- Method: [METHOD]
- Output Format: [FORMAT]

## Segmentation Framework

### 1. Data Preparation
```yaml
feature_selection:
  variables:
    numeric: ["[VAR1]", "[VAR2]"]
    categorical: ["[VAR1]", "[VAR2]"]
    
  preprocessing:
    scaling: "[METHOD]"
    encoding: "[METHOD]"
    
  dimensionality:
    reduction: "[METHOD]"
    features: ["[FEATURE1]", "[FEATURE2]"]
```

### 2. Segmentation Methods
```yaml
clustering:
  algorithm: "[ALGORITHM]"
  parameters:
    n_clusters: "[NUMBER]"
    distance_metric: "[METRIC]"
    
  validation:
    metrics: ["[METRIC1]", "[METRIC2]"]
    thresholds: ["[THRESHOLD1]", "[THRESHOLD2]"]
```

### 3. Segment Analysis
```yaml
segment_profiles:
  characteristics:
    demographic: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
    behavioral: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
    
  metrics:
    size: "[SIZE]"
    stability: "[SCORE]"
    distinctiveness: "[SCORE]"
```

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Exploratory Analysis
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation assessment
- Feature importance
- Outlier detection
- Pattern recognition

### 2. Clustering Techniques
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN
- Gaussian mixture models
- Spectral clustering

### 3. Validation Methods
- Silhouette analysis
- Elbow method
- Gap statistics
- Cross-validation
- Stability assessment

## Output Format
```yaml
segmentation_results:
  overview:
    total_segments: "[NUMBER]"
    quality_score: "[SCORE]"
    stability_score: "[SCORE]"
    
  segments:
    - id: "[SEGMENT_ID]"
      size: "[SIZE]"
      characteristics:
        primary: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
        secondary: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
      
    - id: "[SEGMENT_ID]"
      size: "[SIZE]"
      characteristics:
        primary: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
        secondary: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
        
  insights:
    key_findings: ["[FINDING1]", "[FINDING2]"]
    opportunities: ["[OPP1]", "[OPP2]"]
    recommendations: ["[REC1]", "[REC2]"]
    
  visualization:
    plots: ["[PLOT1]", "[PLOT2]"]
    interpretations: ["[INT1]", "[INT2]"]
```
