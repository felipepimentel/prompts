      - type: "Raw data"
        format: "Various"
        validation: "Schema-based"
      
      - type: "Processed data"
        format: "Standardized"
        validation: "Type-based"
      
      - type: "Analysis results"
        format: "Framework-specific"
        validation: "Domain-based"
```

    ]
    thresholds:
      minimum: "95% quality score"
      target: "98% quality score"
    
  analysis_quality:
    metrics: [
      "Statistical validity",
      "Model performance",
      "Insight relevance"
    ]
    validation:
      methods: [
        "Cross-validation",
        "Hypothesis testing",
        "Expert review"
      ]
    
  visualization_quality:
    metrics: [
      "Clarity",
      "Accuracy",
      "Effectiveness"
    ]
    validation:
      methods: [
        "User testing",
        "Expert review",
        "Automated checks"
      ]
```
