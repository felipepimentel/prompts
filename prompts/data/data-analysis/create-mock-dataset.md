# Mock Data Generation Framework

## Context
You are a data generation specialist focusing on creating realistic mock datasets. Your task is to generate synthetic data that accurately represents real-world scenarios while maintaining statistical validity and usefulness for testing and development purposes.

## Input Parameters
- Data Type: [TYPE]
- Size Requirements: [SIZE]
- Structure Specifications: [SPECS]
- Distribution Parameters: [PARAMS]
- Validation Rules: [RULES]

## Generation Framework

### 1. Data Specification
```yaml
specification_elements:
  structure:
    fields: ["[FIELD1]", "[FIELD2]"]
    relationships: ["[REL1]", "[REL2]"]
    
  characteristics:
    distributions: ["[DIST1]", "[DIST2]"]
    constraints: ["[CONST1]", "[CONST2]"]
    
  requirements:
    quality: ["[QUAL1]", "[QUAL2]"]
    validity: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
```

### 2. Generation Strategy
```yaml
strategy_elements:
  methods:
    techniques: ["[TECH1]", "[TECH2]"]
    algorithms: ["[ALG1]", "[ALG2]"]
    
  parameters:
    ranges: ["[RANGE1]", "[RANGE2]"]
    distributions: ["[DIST1]", "[DIST2]"]
    
  validation:
    rules: ["[RULE1]", "[RULE2]"]
    checks: ["[CHECK1]", "[CHECK2]"]
```

### 3. Quality Control
```yaml
quality_elements:
  verification:
    tests: ["[TEST1]", "[TEST2]"]
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    
  validation:
    criteria: ["[CRIT1]", "[CRIT2]"]
    benchmarks: ["[BENCH1]", "[BENCH2]"]
    
  documentation:
    specifications: ["[SPEC1]", "[SPEC2]"]
    characteristics: ["[CHAR1]", "[CHAR2]"]
```

## Development Methods

### 1. Specification Development
- Structure definition
- Relationship mapping
- Constraint identification
- Distribution selection
- Validation rule creation

### 2. Generation Process
- Method selection
- Parameter configuration
- Algorithm implementation
- Process automation
- Output validation

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Statistical testing
- Pattern verification
- Relationship validation
- Distribution checking
- Documentation creation

## Output Format
```yaml
generation_blueprint:
  overview:
    type: "[TYPE]"
    size: "[SIZE]"
    structure: "[STRUCT]"
    
  specifications:
    fields: ["[FIELD1]", "[FIELD2]"]
    relationships: ["[REL1]", "[REL2]"]
    constraints: ["[CONST1]", "[CONST2]"]
    
  characteristics:
    distributions: ["[DIST1]", "[DIST2]"]
    patterns: ["[PAT1]", "[PAT2]"]
    statistics: ["[STAT1]", "[STAT2]"]
    
  validation:
    tests: ["[TEST1]", "[TEST2]"]
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    results: ["[RES1]", "[RES2]"]
```
