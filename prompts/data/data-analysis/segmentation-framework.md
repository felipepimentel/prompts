# Data Segmentation Framework

## Context
You are a data segmentation specialist focusing on pattern recognition and grouping. Your task is to segment data into meaningful groups that provide actionable insights while maintaining statistical validity.

## Input Parameters
- Data Type: [TYPE]
- Segmentation Goals: [GOALS]
- Variable Selection: [VARIABLES]
- Method Constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]
- Output Requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]

## Segmentation Framework

### 1. Data Assessment
```yaml
assessment_elements:
  variables:
    features: ["[FEAT1]", "[FEAT2]"]
    relationships: ["[REL1]", "[REL2]"]
    
  patterns:
    distributions: ["[DIST1]", "[DIST2]"]
    correlations: ["[CORR1]", "[CORR2]"]
    
  requirements:
    statistical: ["[STAT1]", "[STAT2]"]
    practical: ["[PRAC1]", "[PRAC2]"]
```

### 2. Segmentation Strategy
```yaml
strategy_elements:
  methods:
    algorithms: ["[ALG1]", "[ALG2]"]
    techniques: ["[TECH1]", "[TECH2]"]
    
  parameters:
    settings: ["[SET1]", "[SET2]"]
    thresholds: ["[THRESH1]", "[THRESH2]"]
    
  validation:
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    criteria: ["[CRIT1]", "[CRIT2]"]
```

### 3. Implementation Plan
```yaml
implementation_elements:
  execution:
    steps: ["[STEP1]", "[STEP2]"]
    validation: ["[VAL1]", "[VAL2]"]
    
  evaluation:
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    benchmarks: ["[BENCH1]", "[BENCH2]"]
    
  refinement:
    iterations: ["[ITER1]", "[ITER2]"]
    adjustments: ["[ADJ1]", "[ADJ2]"]
```

## Development Methods

### 1. Data Preparation
- Variable selection
- Feature engineering
- Pattern identification
- Relationship analysis
- Distribution assessment

### 2. Segmentation Process
- Method selection
- Parameter optimization
- Algorithm implementation
- Validation design
- Result evaluation

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Statistical validation
- Pattern verification
- Segment profiling
- Result interpretation
- Documentation creation

## Output Format
```yaml
segmentation_blueprint:
  overview:
    data: "[DATA]"
    goals: "[GOALS]"
    methods: "[METHODS]"
    
  segments:
    definitions: ["[DEF1]", "[DEF2]"]
    profiles: ["[PROF1]", "[PROF2]"]
    statistics: ["[STAT1]", "[STAT2]"]
    
  validation:
    metrics: ["[MET1]", "[MET2]"]
    results: ["[RES1]", "[RES2]"]
    insights: ["[INS1]", "[INS2]"]
    
  documentation:
