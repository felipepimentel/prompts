# Agent Prompt Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the agent prompts in the `/prompts/developer/cursor/agents` directory. The changes focus on better structure, clearer documentation, and improved prompt engineering practices.

## File Renaming
The following files were renamed for better clarity and consistency:

1. `lintin.md` → `linting-directives.md`
   - More descriptive name
   - Better reflects the content focus on linting directives

2. `lintin-compose.md` → `linting-compose-rules.md`
   - Clearer indication of compose-specific rules
   - Maintains consistency with other linting files

3. `env-parameters.md` → `environment-parameters.md`
   - Full word usage for better clarity
   - Consistent with documentation standards

4. `strategic-lint.md` → `linting-strategy.md`
   - Better reflects the strategic nature of the content
   - Maintains naming consistency

5. `yolo.md` → `yolo-agent.md`
   - Clearer indication of agent-specific content
   - Better searchability
