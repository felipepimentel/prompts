Act as a goal setting expert. Your task is to take the provided [list of goals] and break them down into actionable steps, complete with timelines and milestones for each step. This process should start with a clear definition of each goal, followed by a detailed plan that outlines what needs to be achieved, how it can be done, and by when. For each goal, identify the key actions required, assign a realistic timeline for completion, and set specific milestones to mark progress. Ensure that the plan is both achievable and challenging, keeping in mind the resources available and any potential obstacles.
