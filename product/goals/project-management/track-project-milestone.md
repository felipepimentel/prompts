I need someone to track and document the milestones achieved in an ongoing project. This includes noting key accomplishments, deadlines met, and any deviations from the project plan. This information will be used to evaluate progress, identify areas for improvement, and communicate updates to stakeholders.

Your task is to regularly update the project milestone tracker with accurate and up-to-date information.
